# UCSC-CMPE156-Network-Programming HW1 simple remote shell application


This repository consists of The assignments one for course Unix Network Programming.

Programs were developed in C language in Unix system.

   In this assignment, server and client sides of a simple remote shell application were developed
   
Functions:

   The purpose of this project is to develop the server and client sides of a simple remote shell
   application. The user of the client application can type various Unix shell commands,
   which execute on the server and return results back to the client. The command results
   need not be stateful (e.g., cd /tmp, pwd). The client will then display the results on stdout,
 Â  as if the commands were run on the local machine. Data Transmission was through TCP connection.
